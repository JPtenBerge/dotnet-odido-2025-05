## 🧭 Lab Journey Overview – Building a Real Game Step by Step

---

### 🎯 What You'll Be Building

Throughout this course, you'll build a complete **RPG turn-based game** - not all at once, but one step at a time, across multiple labs.

You'll **start simple**: just a few variables and functions in a console app.  
No fancy architecture. No web stuff. No frameworks. Just pure C#.

Then, as you learn new language features and concepts, you'll **refactor**, **split**, **improve**, and **extend** your game:
- From basic variables → to classes and interfaces
- From one project → to a **multi-project solution**
- From manual logic → to **Entity Framework** and a real **SQLite database**
- From local play → to a **stateless Web API**
- From console → to a **Blazor website** using server-side components and real HTTP calls

By the end, you'll have a working **multi-layer application**, built in C# and .NET:
- With a **Business Logic** layer that contains the rules of the game  
- A **Data Layer** that saves and loads game state from a database  
- A **Web API** that exposes endpoints for frontend access  
- And a **Blazor app** where players can start, continue, and play games via a browser

### ⚙️ The Game Mechanics

Here's what you'll eventually implement:

- The user controls a **Hero**
- The Hero fights against a **Boss**
- Each turn, the Hero can **attack** or **heal**
- The Boss also takes turns (you'll simulate the AI)
- When one character's **health drops to 0**, the game ends
- The game **automatically saves** after each turn
- The player can **resume an existing game** or **start a new one**
- Games are stored in a **SQLite database**

### 🛠️ How the Labs Work

Each lab builds on the previous one:

- You'll write **some real code** right away
- You'll sometimes make **decisions that seem okay at first**... but will need to be **revisited** as you learn more
- You'll **refactor and improve** the structure using new tools and concepts
- You'll **see firsthand why software architecture matters**

By doing this, you'll not only learn C# - you'll also understand why things are done a certain way in enterprise applications, especially the kind of software you're working with at your job.

### 💡 Tips for Success

- Don't worry if your code isn't perfect - that's the point!
- Focus on **understanding why** each step matters
- Ask questions - especially if something feels confusing or weird
- Trust the process: each lab brings you closer to a fully working app
